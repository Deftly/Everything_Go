In a module, you collect one or more related packages that have a set of useful functions. For example, you might create a module with packages that have functions for doing financial analysis so that others writing financial applications can utalize those functions.

Go code is grouped into pacakges, and packages are grouped into modules. Your module specifies dependencies needed to run your code, including the Go version and the set of other modules it requires.
